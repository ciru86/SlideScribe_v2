# Slidescribe v2

A reproducible pipeline to convert lecture videos into structured, slide-aligned documents (PDF/DOCX) using deterministic preprocessing and LLM-assisted text normalization.

---

## Features

* End-to-end pipeline: video → slides → subtitles → structured text → PDF/DOCX
* Deterministic preprocessing (ffmpeg / yt-dlp)
* Chunked SRT processing for LLM stability
* Slide–text alignment via per-slide segmentation
* Reproducible environment via local `.venv`
* Script-first design (no global Python state required)

---

## Requirements

### System

* macOS / Linux (tested on macOS arm64)
* `bash` (>= 4)
* `ffmpeg`
* `yt-dlp`

Install via Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp
```

### Python

* Python >= 3.10

All Python dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Setup

### 1. Python environment

Create the project virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
./create_venv.sh
```

This will:

* create `.venv/`
* install `requirements.txt`
* ensure a self-contained runtime

> Do **not** rely on system Python.

All Python scripts must be executed via:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python
```

---

### 2. ChatGPT Wrapper

The orchestrator depends on a local `chatgpt` CLI wrapper to communicate with the API.

#### Install binary

```bash
mv chatgpt ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/chatgpt
```

#### Configure API key

```bash
nano ~/.secrets
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY={{YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}}
```

#### Update shell configuration (`~/.zshrc`)

```bash
# User bin
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"

# Secrets
[ -f ~/.secrets ] && source ~/.secrets
```

Apply changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Verify

```bash
which chatgpt
chatgpt --help
```

The pipeline will fail if the wrapper is not available in `$PATH` or if the API key is missing.

---

## Usage

Run the orchestrator:

```bash
./Slidescribe_v2.sh
```

Interactive parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| WORKDIR        | Output working directory        |
| VIDEO_URL      | YouTube source                  |
| VIDEO_BASENAME | Base name for all artifacts     |
| PROMPT         | LLM correction prompt           |
| ROI_MODE       | Optional slide region selection |

---

## Subtitles Language

`yt-dlp` is currently invoked with:

```bash
--sub-langs "it,it-IT,it.*,ita"
```

To change subtitle language, modify this flag directly inside `Slidescribe_v2.sh`.

Examples:

* English:

```bash
--sub-langs "en,en-US,en.*,eng"
```

* Multi-language fallback:

```bash
--sub-langs "en,it,en.*,it.*"
```

No runtime flag is currently exposed: this is a **hardcoded configuration**.

## Architecture

The pipeline is intentionally split into deterministic and probabilistic stages.

### Deterministic stages

* Video download (`yt-dlp`)
* Audio extraction (`ffmpeg`)
* Subtitle retrieval (auto-subs)
* Frame sampling / slide extraction
* Slide indexing (`slides.csv`)

### Probabilistic stage (LLM)

* Text normalization
* Error correction (ASR noise)
* Readability improvement (non-semantic)

LLM usage is **strictly bounded**:

* no content generation
* no hallucination tolerance
* timestamp preservation enforced

## Data Model

### slides.csv

| Column     | Description     |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| slide_id   | incremental id  |
| timestamp  | frame timestamp |
| image_path | slide image     |

### SRT (post-processing)

* normalized block duration
* chunk-safe segmentation
* LLM-corrected text

---

## Design Choices

### Chunking strategy

Large transcripts are split into manageable chunks to:

* reduce token overflow risk
* increase determinism
* allow partial retries

### No full-SRT LLM pass

Avoids:

* formatting corruption
* timestamp drift
* catastrophic failures on long inputs

### Explicit interpreter usage

Avoids environment leakage and ensures reproducibility.

---

## Error Handling

* `set -euo pipefail` enforced in shell scripts
* early exit on missing dependencies
* intermediate artifacts preserved for debugging

Recommended checks:

```bash
shellcheck Slidescribe_v2.sh
```

---

## Performance Considerations

* Frame extraction is CPU-bound
* LLM stage is latency-bound
* Chunk size is the main trade-off parameter

---

## Limitations

* Dependent on subtitle quality (ASR errors propagate)
* Slide detection assumes stable layouts
* No semantic restructuring (by design)

---

## Roadmap

* Parallel chunk processing
* Deterministic slide detection improvements
* Optional GUI (SwiftUI frontend)
* Config file (YAML/JSON) instead of interactive input

---

## Contributing

PRs should:

* preserve deterministic stages
* avoid increasing LLM surface area
* maintain reproducibility
